      </Wrapper>
      <List>
        <ListItem>
          <Wrapper>
            1. Ask for feedback <LessBold>throughout the semester</LessBold>.
            Students are more likely to provide constructive feedback if they
            know that they will personally benefit from it.
          </Wrapper>
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <Wrapper>
            2. Make it easy for students to access your feedback surveys, i.e.{" "}

        Once you have finished gathering feedback, it is immediately time to
        read through the responses. According to Kember et al. (2008), there are
        four stages of self-reflection that you may encounter as you take in the
        feedback. Quoting Benton and Cashin (2012),
      </Wrapper>
      <List>
        <ListItem>
          <Wrapper>
            1. <LessBold>Nonreflection</LessBold>: “an instructor simply looks
            through the ratings without giving them much thought”
          </Wrapper>
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <Wrapper>
            2. <LessBold>Understanding</LessBold>: “the instructor attempts to
            grasp what the ratings mean but does not relate them to his or her
            own experiences”
          </Wrapper>
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <Wrapper>
            3. <LessBold>Reflection</LessBold>: “instructors relate the results
            to their own experience teaching the specifi course”
          </Wrapper>

        <ListItem>
          <Wrapper>
            4. <LessBold>Critical reflection</LessBold>: “the teacher undergoes
            a transformation in perspective”
          </Wrapper>
        </ListItem>
      </List>

      <Wrapper break>
        Ideally, you would be able to reach this critical reflection phase and
        turn it into actionable changes that can be made to the course. Research
        has also suggested that discussing the ratings with a peer instructor or
        consultant can significantly enhance the usefulness of the feedback
        Benton and Cashin (2012). You could consider reaching out to peer
        instructors in your department or consultants from the McGraw Center to
        help identify ways to act upon student feedback.
      </Wrapper>

      <Wrapper break>
        It's easy to resist critical student feedback -- however, you have to
        remember that college students have been in school for many years and
        house an expert understanding of their preferred teaching style and
        course organization. If you approach student feedback with humility and
        openness, you can explore ways to improve your pedagogical skills, while
        simultaneously building up trust from your students.
